fully-automatic on-chain pump.fun solana MEVbot leveraging flashloans and the minimal gas fees of Solana to perform sandwich attacks and front-runs on https://pump.fun. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the atomic nature of Flashloan operations, if they aren't profitable the transaction will revert and no net profit will be lost.

# Operation
```mermaid

A[MEVBOT] --Identify TX -->C(Mev Buy)--> E(Target Buy)

F -->J(no arb)
J--tx reverted -->A
F --> H(arbitrage) --profit --> A
```
- The bot is constantly sniffing the https://pump.fun Solana master SPL for user buys, sells, and token creations containing slippage deficits.
> [!TIP]
> Bot operators can target any transaction value within their balance threshold. Generally, higher thresholds net consistently viable transactions
-  Once a transaction is identified, a flashloan is initiated for the target transaction amount, this requires a marginal amount of collateral.
-  The bot will aggresively attempt to front-run the transaction by dynamically monitoring the bribe to the miner and increasing it if necessary so as to be the first transaction mined.
- Depending on the set parameters, the bot will either front-run the Dev's sell to remain in profit, or sell upon the token reaching KOTH.
- The flashloan is then repaid, collateral is reiumbursed and profits are deposited into the operators wallet.
-  If the transaction is unprofitable at any point it will be reverted and the flashloan will be repaid, losing no gas or net profit.

# Tips

- Chrome-based browsers must have developer mode enabled to support the TamperMonkey extension, you can find the toggle in the top right of the extensions page.

- Increase the flashloan limit by .5 - 1 SOL if you wish to target more than one or two coins at a time.
